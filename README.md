## SQL Sales Data Analysis

Analyzed a retail sales dataset to explore revenue patterns across product categories, states, and sub-categories using SQL.

**Tools:** SQL (SQLite), Python, pandas  
**Techniques:** Data loading, aggregation (SUM, AVG), grouping, ordering, analysis  

### Key Findings
- Technology is the highest-revenue category by total sales.
- Sales are concentrated in a small number of states, led by California and New York.
- Sub-category performance differs by metric: Copiers rank highest by average sales per order, while Phones generate the highest total revenue.

This project demonstrates the use of SQL to answer business-style analytical questions on structured data.
